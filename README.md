<h1>1.What is Middleware❓</h1><hr></hr>
<p>✏️The middleware in node. js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle.
Middleware can also send the response to the server before the request.</p>
